# Day 8
## 6 August 2018

**Task:** Started Course 3 of deeplearning.ai (Structuring Machine Learning Projects).  
Working on my gradient descent python code.  
Learning how to use kaggle datasets.  

# Day 9
## 7 August 2018

**Task:** Revising pandas, matlotlib and coding gradient descent. Found and ran a dataset for linear regression.  
**Remarks:** Installed ubuntu(windows wasn't running jupyter properly).  
These tasks are taking unusually long.  

# Day 10
## 8 August 2018

**Task:** Completed my gradient descent code but it looks broken. Need to fix it.
